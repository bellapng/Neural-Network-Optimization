# Neural-Network-Optimization

### IDE Information
Created with Python 3.13 interpreter using PyCharm. Exploratory data analysis was initially done via Google Colab before creating scripts.

### Package Dependencies
There are several packages required to run this script:  
1. pandas
2. numpy
3. matplotlib
4. scikit-learn
5. ucimlrepo (vital for dataset importation)

### Running the Script
Once the required packages are correctly installed, you may run the NeuralNet.py script. Please allow sufficient time for models to train properly, especially during the hyperparameter tuning phase.
An appropriate messages will be printed to the display when plots/model training is occuring.

### Analysis of Results
Please view the report file attached for the plots, tuning logs, and analysis.
